    Generate an image using the generation service from the dream studio project.
    Returns a SFW PIL image.
    if NSFW will return a NSFW Warning PIL image.
    to be used this function you need to have a valid STABILITY_API_KEY set in the environment variables.
    get the STABILITY_API_KEY at https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream/membership

    Args:
        prompt (str): The prompt to use for the generation service
        samples (int): The number of samples to generate from the generation service. >1 Not supported so far (default: 1)
        steps (int): The number of steps to use for the generation service (higher is better)
        scale (float): The scale to use for the generation service (recommended between 0.0 and 15.0)
        seed (int): The seed to use for the generation service (default: 396916372)

    Returns:
