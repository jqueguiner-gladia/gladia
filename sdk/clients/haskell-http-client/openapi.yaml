          default: 'The Crown is a historical drama streaming television series about
            the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, created and principally written by Peter
            Morgan, and produced by Left Bank Pictures and Sony Pictures Television
            for Netflix. Morgan developed it from his drama film The Queen (2006)
            and especially his stage play The Audience (2013). The first season covers
            the period from Elizabeth''s marriage to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in
            1947 to the disintegration of her sister Princess Margaret''s engagement
            to Group Captain Peter Townsend in 1955. The second season covers the
            period from the Suez Crisis in 1956 to the retirement of Prime Minister
            Harold Macmillan in 1963 and the birth of Prince Edward in 1964. The third
            season spans 1964 to 1977, includes Harold Wilson''s two periods as prime
            minister, and introduces Camilla Shand. The fourth season spans 1979 to
            the early 1990s and includes Margaret Thatcher''s tenure as prime minister
            and Prince Charles''s marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. The fifth and sixth
            seasons, which will close the series, will cover the Queen''s reign into
            the 21st century. For each of the two-season increments, new actors fill
            the roles to account for the ageing process in the periods of time portrayed.
            Claire Foy portrays the Queen in the first two seasons, alongside Matt
            Smith as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret. For the
            third and fourth seasons, Olivia Colman takes over as the Queen, Tobias
            Menzies as Prince Philip, and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret.
            Also added to the cast in season 3 is Josh O''Connor as Prince Charles.
            In the fourth season, new cast members include Emma Corrin as Lady Diana
            Spencer and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher. Imelda Staunton, Jonathan
            Pryce, and Lesley Manville will succeed Colman, Menzies, and Bonham Carter,
            respectively, for the final two seasons, while Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic
            West are expected to assume the role of Princess Diana and Prince Charles,
            respectively. Filming takes place at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire,
            with location shooting throughout the United Kingdom and internationally.
            The first season was released by Netflix on 4 November 2016, the second
            on 8 December 2017, the third on 17 November 2019, and the fourth on 15
            November 2020. The fifth season is anticipated in 2022. As of 2020, the
            estimated production budget of The Crown has been reported to be $260
            million, making it one of the most expensive television series in history.[4]
            The Crown was praised by critics for its acting, directing, writing, cinematography,
            and production values, although its historical inaccuracies have received
            some criticism, particularly within the fourth season. Nonetheless, it
            received accolades at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, Foy won Best
            Actress in the lead role and Best Actor for John Lithgow as Winston Churchill,
            and has secured a total of sixty three nominations for its first four
            seasons at the Primetime Emmy Awards, including four for Outstanding Drama
            Series.[5] The series has also twice won the Golden Globe Award for Best
            Television Series - Drama, at the 74th and 78th ceremonies, with additional
            acting wins for Foy, Colman, Corrin, O''Connor and Anderson.[6] '

          default: 'The Crown is a historical drama streaming television series about
            the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, created and principally written by Peter
            Morgan, and produced by Left Bank Pictures and Sony Pictures Television
            for Netflix. Morgan developed it from his drama film The Queen (2006)
            and especially his stage play The Audience (2013). The first season covers
            the period from Elizabeth''s marriage to Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in
            1947 to the disintegration of her sister Princess Margaret''s engagement
            to Group Captain Peter Townsend in 1955. The second season covers the
            period from the Suez Crisis in 1956 to the retirement of Prime Minister
            Harold Macmillan in 1963 and the birth of Prince Edward in 1964. The third
            season spans 1964 to 1977, includes Harold Wilson''s two periods as prime
            minister, and introduces Camilla Shand. The fourth season spans 1979 to
            the early 1990s and includes Margaret Thatcher''s tenure as prime minister
            and Prince Charles''s marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. The fifth and sixth
            seasons, which will close the series, will cover the Queen''s reign into
            the 21st century. For each of the two-season increments, new actors fill
            the roles to account for the ageing process in the periods of time portrayed.
            Claire Foy portrays the Queen in the first two seasons, alongside Matt
            Smith as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret. For the
            third and fourth seasons, Olivia Colman takes over as the Queen, Tobias
            Menzies as Prince Philip, and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret.
            Also added to the cast in season 3 is Josh O''Connor as Prince Charles.
            In the fourth season, new cast members include Emma Corrin as Lady Diana
            Spencer and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher. Imelda Staunton, Jonathan
            Pryce, and Lesley Manville will succeed Colman, Menzies, and Bonham Carter,
            respectively, for the final two seasons, while Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic
            West are expected to assume the role of Princess Diana and Prince Charles,
            respectively. Filming takes place at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire,
            with location shooting throughout the United Kingdom and internationally.
            The first season was released by Netflix on 4 November 2016, the second
            on 8 December 2017, the third on 17 November 2019, and the fourth on 15
            November 2020. The fifth season is anticipated in 2022. As of 2020, the
            estimated production budget of The Crown has been reported to be $260
            million, making it one of the most expensive television series in history.[4]
            The Crown was praised by critics for its acting, directing, writing, cinematography,
            and production values, although its historical inaccuracies have received
            some criticism, particularly within the fourth season. Nonetheless, it
            received accolades at the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards, Foy won Best
            Actress in the lead role and Best Actor for John Lithgow as Winston Churchill,
            and has secured a total of sixty three nominations for its first four
            seasons at the Primetime Emmy Awards, including four for Outstanding Drama
            Series.[5] The series has also twice won the Golden Globe Award for Best
            Television Series - Drama, at the 74th and 78th ceremonies, with additional
            acting wins for Foy, Colman, Corrin, O''Connor and Anderson.[6] '
