## How can I contribute?

There are three ways to contribute to GladIA:
1. By [submiting a bug report](###Your-first-bug-report)
2. By [submiting a feature request](####Your-first-feature-request)
3. By [submiting a pull request](####Your-first-pull-request) addressing an issue

### Your first bug report

This section describes how to write and submit a bug report. This includes crashes, memory leaks or any unexpected behaviours.

#### What do I need to check before submitting my issue?
 * You use the latest version of GladIA
 * You have all the correct dependencies
 * The issue doesn't already exist
 * Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

#### How to write a great issue report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](http://github.com/gladiaio/gladia/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

A good way to know if your issue is well described is to ask yourself "using the provided informations and only the provided informations, am I able to reproduce the behaviour and know why there is a bug?". If the answer is no, that mean you need to be more specific regarding how to reproduce the behaviour and what to expect.

Once it's filed, a team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps and add it to our backlog until one of our member is able to take care of it or a community member wants to fix it.

### Your first feature request

If you consider submitting an enhancement suggestion for GladIA, whether it is for a brand new feature or for a minor improvement, this section is for you!

#### What should I do before submitting my feature request?

- Be sure that the feature doesn't already exist 🙂.
- Check if the feature has already been requested.

#### How do I write a great feature request?

As for bug reports, feature requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](http://github.com/gladiaio/gladia/issues).

  - Open an [Issue](http://github.com/gladiaio/gladia/issues/new) with a clear and descriptive title
  - Write what feature would you like to see integrated in GladIA
